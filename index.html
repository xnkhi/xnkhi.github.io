My name is Ankhi. I live on planet Earth.

I have several aliases on the internet:
  - Ankhi
  - xnkhi
  - xnkh
  - ankh

 ____                           _     _

|  __/| | |  __| (_| | | | | | | |_) | |  __/
|_|   |_|  \___|\__,_|_| |_| |_|_.__/|_|\___|

Like most, I too once lived with my mother. 
A shit one. Fuck that bitch.

Childhood for me was atypical. Aside from school or my place of work, my youth
was spent confined within a small room with nothing but a Dell Latitude E6440
and a ROG Strix G513QY as my window to the outside world. My life was spent on
the internet, until I eventually left that house at the age of eighteen.
I now have a home, and a social circle of my own.

Despite being cut off from my local community, I was never truly isolated.
A computer monitor can display a raw and unfiltered view of the world if you
know what buttons to press.

I created this website to write about myself and my thoughts.

Although I am now a free woman, I still hold true to my original interests.

I value knowledge. Rather than having a focus on one specific concept, I divide my
attention between many. I find that comprehension of the world in which we live is
most valuable.

My world was a computer, so a lot of my knowledge is centered around them.

I have a deep understanding of the following, in descending order:
  - Technology (no particular order)
      -- History
      -- Programming
      -- Cybersecurity
      -- Operational security
      -- The Linux and FOSS ecosystem
  - Unethical business practices
      -- Particularly consumer exploitation
  - Government corruption
  - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea
  - Drugs
  - Ancient Egyptian mythology
  - Astronomy
  - Quantum mechanics
    -- "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum
       mechanics." - Richard Feynman

I have met people from the following places:
  - United Kingdom
  - France
  - Germany
  - Italy
  - Romania
  - Lithuania
  - Turkey
  - Netherlands
  - Saudi Arabia
  - Russia
  - North Korea
  - South Korea
  - India
  - China
  - Brazil
  - Mexico
  - Canada
  - United States

  Still no Japan or Egypt? Or even places like Liberia or Djibouti? That sucks.
